# Page-Turner

## Description
Page-turner is a search-engine that specializes in books and literature, using the Google Books API. It is initially set up with a RESTful API infrastructure, however, it needed to be switched to a GraphQL API structure, which involves the construction of Type Definitions and Resolvers on the back-end, and Queries/Mutations on the front-end. Here, the user will be able to search for books using key-words/titles in the search bar at the top, and saving books they are interested in reading down the line. DO NOTE that in order to save books to your list, you'd need to create an account in the nav bar at the top.
